    About Us
}

We here at Alta Vista know how important technology is going to be in our future as a 
species so we set up this school to help the new generation get a leg up on the 
competition. Our technology program is one of the best tech programs for non-college 
students in the nation with our primary focus being how to use technology and how to 
improve it.

While our school is primarily math, science and tech focused, we also give the same 
education as a regular school program would. We worked with education officials in the 
state to make sure all of our programs were up to par with public schools. This will 
help get the leg up on their fellow students when they graduate form Alta Vista as not 
only will they have the regular classes needed but also they will have a more firm grasp 
on math and science.
